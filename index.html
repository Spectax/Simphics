<p><em>A Simple JavaScript Game Engine</em></p>

<p>Current Version: 0.2</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Simphics is a Game Engine written in Javascript written for fun as a hobby.
You may use it as you wish under the MIT license (Open Source).</p>

<h2>Modules</h2>

<p>The following modules are under development</p>

<h3>Single Player Game Engine - To run in a Web Browser</h3>

<h3>Multiplayer Game Engine - To run on NodeJS</h3>

<h3>Physics Engine</h3>

<h3>Math Engine</h3>

<h2>Miscellaneous Information</h2>

<p>Simphics ideally should simplify stuff.</p>

<p>The simphics single player game engine should be able to replicate many of the standard game engine features such as game loop and game state.
Being written in javascript it should be able to run in a browser, and using HTML and CSS, games should be easy to design.</p>

<p>There will be a generic simphics_game.js that will contain the main game engine logic.
Then the simphics_single_web.js would wrap around that, to execute in the web.</p>

<p>There will be simphics_multiplayer_client.js and simphics_multiplayer_server.js for multiplayer capability using node.js as the server</p>

<p>simphics_physics.js and simphics_math.js are generic, but tailored to integrate well into the simphics game engine</p>
